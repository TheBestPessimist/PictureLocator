(_give credit where credit is due_)


Here i will ~~name~~ _note_ the libraries and whoever else helped me do this project.
Expect anything from (_nick_-)names, to libraries and StackOverflow links.

Also, do expect informality. I'm that kind of a guy :^).


0.  The internets :-). Gosh i love you.


1.  For reading GPX files i use [GeoKarambolaLib](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/110606810455751902142)
    created by Afonso Santos.

    This library is modified to handle custom date formats.

    Unfortunately, as the creator of the said library wants to be compliant with the GPX standard, he will
    not accept this improvement.
    He does have a valid point about other applications following the GPX standard, but i still
    believe this would be a useful feature, as we do not live in a perfect word :D.

    The wonderful discussion about implementing my change can be found [here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+CristianViorelPasat/posts/Dk9HKcoELuD).
